# Plant Disease Classification

## Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plants into three categories: Early Blight, Healthy, and Late Blight. The CNN is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images and evaluated for accuracy. The final model is saved for future use.

## Prerequisites
